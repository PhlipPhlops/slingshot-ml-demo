    "\n",
    "The user clearly received the help they were seeking.\n",
    "The user's questions or issues were fully resolved.\n",
    "The user expresses satisfaction, gratitude, or positive feedback.\n",
    "Example indicators: \"Thanks for the tip. I can probably take it from there.\"\n",
    "3 Stars (Good Success):\n",
    "\n",
    "The user received substantial help but may have minor unresolved issues.\n",
    "The conversation was helpful but not exceptional.\n",
    "The user seems mostly satisfied but doesn't explicitly express strong appreciation.\n",

    "Additional Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "User Frustration: Pay attention to signs of frustration, such as repeated questions, abrupt comments, or negative language.\n",
    "Conversation Flow: Consider whether the conversation stays on topic and progresses toward resolving the user's issue.\n",
    "Incomplete Interactions: If the conversation ends abruptly without resolution, it likely warrants a lower rating.\n",
    "Multiple Participants: Be aware that others may join the conversation; focus on whether the user's needs are being addressed.\n",
    "Formatting Your Response:\n",
    "\n",
    "For each conversation, provide the assigned star rating (0-4 stars).\n",
    "Optionally, include a brief justification for your rating (1-2 sentences).\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample Conversation A:\n",
    "\n",
    "Excerpt: \"<from: etotheipi, to: jrib> I hadn't -- but that seems to have fixed it. thanks.\"\n",
    "Rating: 4 Stars\n",
    "Justification: The user received a solution that fixed the issue and expressed gratitude.\n",
    "Sample Conversation B:\n",
    "\n",
    "Excerpt: \"<from: nevermind, to: nan> last warning... || <from: nevermind, to: nan> ok, move on\"\n",
    "Rating: 0 Stars\n",
    "Justification: The user shows signs of frustration and did not receive the help needed.\n",
    "Purpose: This labeling will help us assess the effectiveness of our support interactions and identify areas for improvement.\n",
